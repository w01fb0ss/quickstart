# Vue-Webpack-Electron-Neon-Quickstart
* Let's put aside the horror of that name, and get into what this actually does
* This is a boilerplate repo that allows vue that has been installed via vue-cli and electron added on with the electron-builder plugin to work with neon-bindings. The solution for getting the native module to load is pretty hacky, so I'll need to find a way to load the module properly on a build for distribution.
